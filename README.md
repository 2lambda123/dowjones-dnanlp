## Setup and Installation

The instructions that follow assume that you run a **Docker container** or a **cloud instance** with the latest version of Ubunutu (18.10 at the time of this writing).

The following assumes that you have set up a cloud instance (e.g. on DigitalOcean) and have used `ssh` to login as `root` or have started a Docker container locally. To start a Docker container locally e.g. execute on the shell:

    docker run -ti -h dnanlp -p 9999:9999 ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

Then on the shell of the Docker container or the cloud instance execute the following:

    wget http://hilpisch.com/nlp/setup_dna_nlp.sh
    bash setup_dna_nlp.sh

Follow the **instructions** of the script to e.g. provide a password for the Jupyter Notebook server.

After the installation, you can access the **Jupyter Notebook server** under

    http://localhost:9999

or

    http://CLOUD_IP_ADDRESS:9999

with your chosen password. Navigate via Jupyter to the code folder and open a notebook to get started.
